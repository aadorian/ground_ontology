# Grounded Research Ontology Wiki

Welcome to the **Grounded Research Ontology** wiki! This ontology models qualitative research methodology structured into four main phases: Project Formulation, Data Collection, Consensus, and Finding.

## 🎯 Overview

The Grounded Research Ontology represents the cyclical and interconnected process of conducting grounded theory research. It provides a formal structure for modeling:

- Research project formulation and planning
- Data collection and organization
- Consensus-building through reflexivity and interpretation
- Findings and theory development

## 📊 Ontology Statistics

- **25 Classes** organized across 4 research phases
- **22 Object Properties** defining relationships between concepts
- **Hierarchical structures** from Grounded Theory to Codes
- **Cyclical relationships** supporting iterative research processes

## 🎓 Research Phases

1. **Project Formulation** - Research objectives, theoretical frameworks, researchers, methods
2. **Data Collection** - Bibliographies, subjects/objects, records (interviews, field notes, documents)
3. **Consensus** - Reflexivity, interpretation, method application
4. **Finding** - Reports, grounded theory, analytic categories, descriptive categories, codes

## 💡 Key Features

- **Cyclical Nature**: Supports iterative research processes with reformulation cycles
- **Hierarchical Structures**: From Grounded Theory through Analytic and Descriptive Categories to Codes
- **Cross-Phase Relationships**: Connections between all research phases
- **Comprehensive Query Support**: SPARQL, DL queries, and class definitions
